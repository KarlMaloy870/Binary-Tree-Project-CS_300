# Binary-Tree-Project-CS_300



What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

creating code that could take a file of course and sort them while allowing for the courses and their information to be searchable.



How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

we used hash tables, linked list, vectors, and binary trees to accomplish this and learned their individual uses.



How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

i used my resources such as my professor, YouTube, stack overflow and other websites with coding help.



How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

i learned a good bit from these projects actually on the use of recourses i was able to solve problems like never before and will implement that into my code in the future.



How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

i would say the project just gave me more experience with my writing and was another "piece of the puzzle" so to say.
